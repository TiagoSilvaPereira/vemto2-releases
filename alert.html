    <br><span class="text-red-500 font-bold">Vemto 2.1.7 Beta - First 2025 version</span>
    <br><br>
    <b class="text-red-500">IMPORTANT:</b> this is an essential version with important improvements and bug fixes. If your Vemto executable is not updating automatically, it is highly recommended to download the new version from the website.

    <span class="text-red-500 font-bold">Blueprint Mode</span>
    <br><br>
    Vemto now has a new project mode called Blueprint Mode, which is default when creating new projects. In this mode, Vemto only synchronizes with the application's source code on the first connection, or if you explicitly request it (using the "Sync Schema" option in the Schema Designer).
    <br><br>
    <b>We strongly recommend using this mode for new projects</b>, as it is much faster and ignores errors in the source code (so that, Vemto can generate code and save migrations even if the application's source code has errors or is incompatible with Vemto).

    <span class="text-red-500 font-bold">Templates Editor</span>
    <br><br>
    The Templates Editor is finally available in this version. You can now edit the templates used by Vemto to generate code and migrations. 
    Now, Vemto will create a .vemto/templates/published and a .vemto/templates/custom folder in your project. The first one contains the templates that come with Vemto, and the second one contains the templates that you can edit (and that will override the default ones).

    <span class="text-red-500 font-bold">Migrations Schema Reader - deprecated</span>
    <br><br>
    The Migrations Schema Reader is deprecated and will keep working only with Laravel 11 projects (not available for Laravel 12+ projects). This Reader was createad just for development purposes, and with the Database Schema Reader and the Blueprint Mode, it is no longer necessary. This also makes it more easy to maintain and improve Vemto, as we now have only one Schema Reader to maintain.
    <br><br>

    <span class="text-red-500 font-bold">Pages Creator/Editor - deprecated</span>
    <br><br>
    The Pages Creator/Editor is deprecated and will keep working only with old Vemto projects. This was an experimental feature and we decided to remove it to reduce the complexity of the Vemto's scope.
    <br><br>

    <span class="text-red-500 font-bold">What about Laravel 12 support?</span>
    <br><br>
    We are working hard to support Laravel 12 in the next version of Vemto. Our original plan was to launch L12 support in this version, but we noticed some issues when reading the database schema, and we decided to postpone it to the next version.

    <br><br>
    Thank you for your attention and support! 
    <br><br>
    Yours sincerely,
    <br>
